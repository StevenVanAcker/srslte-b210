- LTE is 4G but don't expect srslte to support 2G functions like voice and SMS!
  (Check openbts for that)
- Need to configure MCC and MNC to in enb.conf and epc.conf to match the SIM
  card IMSI
- Set the dl_earfcn (enb.conf) to a band that the UE supports
- Set the APN name to something the phone expects, may need to configure the
  APN in the phone
	- APN name
	- APN protocol IPv4
- Using a GPSDO with 5V GPS antenna seems to be required to get a good signal,
  even though some people were lucky to have a more or less accurate clock.
- Using Sysmocom USIMs out of the box works. However, reprogrammed cards with
  different values does not. I'm not sure why, further research is needed.
- Tested with 4 phones:
	- Samsung Galaxy S9 (SM-960F): works
	- iPhone SE (software version 14.4.1): doesn't work (not sure why?)
	- Motorola G2 (XT1068): doesn't work since it doesn't support LTE
	- Samsung Galaxy S III Mini (GT-i8190): doesn't work since it doesn't
	  support LTE
- Sending too much network traffic will cause packet loss, disconnecting the
  phone sometimes
